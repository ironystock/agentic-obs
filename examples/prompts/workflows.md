## Tips for Workflow Prompts

1. **Break complex workflows into steps**: List each action in sequence
2. **Verify critical operations**: Always ask for confirmation on recording/streaming status
3. **Specify timing**: Indicate when actions should happen (now vs. when you say so)
4. **Include all details**: Scene names, audio levels, what should continue running
5. **Plan for interruptions**: Know your emergency procedures
6. **Test workflows**: Run through complete sequences before going live
7. **Save successful patterns**: Reuse workflows that work well
8. **Adapt on the fly**: Don't be afraid to modify mid-stream

## Common Workflow Patterns

### The Basic Stream Pattern
1. Pre-stream scene + start streaming
2. Start recording when content begins
3. Main content scene(s)
4. Break scene (optional)
5. Outro scene
6. Stop recording and streaming

### The Recording Session Pattern
1. Setup scene
2. Start recording
3. Content scene(s) with pauses between takes
4. Stop recording
5. Verify saved

### The Audio Balance Pattern
1. Set mic level for your voice
2. Set game/content audio lower
3. Set music/background even lower
4. Adjust based on content (talking vs. gameplay)

## Troubleshooting Workflows

**When audio is wrong:**
- "Audio check: tell me current levels for my mic, game audio, and desktop audio, then set them to 85%, 45%, and 30%"

**When scene is wrong:**
- "Scene check: what scene am I on? What scenes exist? Switch me to Gaming scene"

**When recording status is unclear:**
- "Status check: am I recording? Am I streaming? What scene am I on? Give me full status"

**Complete reset:**
- "Stop everything: stop recording, stop streaming, switch to Idle scene, mute all audio, give me clean slate"

## Visual Monitoring Workflows

### Stream with Visual Verification

**AI-assisted stream with visual checks:**

1. "Set up visual monitoring of my stream with 10-second captures called 'stream-check'"

2. "Pre-stream check: switch to Starting Soon scene and take a screenshot to verify it looks correct"

3. "Going live - switch to Gaming scene, start streaming, and confirm visually that everything looks good"

4. "Periodic check: how does my stream look? Any issues with the layout?"

5. "Wrapping up: switch to Outro scene, verify it displays correctly, then stop streaming"

6. "Stream complete: remove the screenshot monitoring"

### Scene Change Verification

**Verifying scene transitions:**

1. "Set up a screenshot source called 'scene-verify' with 2-second captures"

2. "Switch to my Gaming scene"
   AI: [Switches scene, waits for capture]
   AI: "Scene switched. Your Gaming scene shows: webcam in bottom right, game capture in center, chat overlay on left. Everything looks properly positioned."

3. "Now switch to BRB scene and verify"
   AI: [Switches scene, waits for capture]
   AI: "BRB scene is now active. Your 'Be Right Back' message is centered, animated background is running, and chat is hidden as expected."

4. "Good, clean up the screenshot source"

### Problem Detection Workflow

**Diagnosing stream issues with AI help:**

1. "Chat says something looks wrong with my stream. Set up rapid screenshot capture so you can help diagnose"

2. "Take a look - what do you see?"
   AI: "I can see your webcam is showing but your game capture appears to be a black rectangle. The overlay and chat are fine."

3. "I'll try restarting the game capture. Tell me when it's working"
   [You restart game capture in OBS]
   AI: "Game capture is now showing your game. The issue is resolved."

4. "Great, slow down the captures to every 30 seconds for general monitoring"

### Pre-Stream Visual Checklist

**Comprehensive visual pre-flight:**

1. "I'm about to stream. Set up visual monitoring and run through my scenes"

2. "Check Starting Soon scene"
   AI: "Starting Soon scene looks good: countdown timer visible, logo centered, social links displayed at bottom."

3. "Check Gaming scene"
   AI: "Gaming scene ready: webcam active and showing you, game capture is live, alerts overlay positioned correctly."

4. "Check BRB scene"
   AI: "BRB scene verified: message centered, chat hidden, background animation running."

5. "Check Outro scene"
   AI: "Outro scene ready: social links visible, 'Thanks for watching' text displayed, music player hidden."

6. "Perfect, switch to Starting Soon and start streaming"

### Recording with Visual QA

**Quality assurance for recordings:**

1. "I'm recording a tutorial. Set up screenshot monitoring so you can help with quality"

2. "Start recording on my Tutorial scene"
   AI: [Starts recording, captures screenshot]
   AI: "Recording started. Your Tutorial scene shows: screen capture is clear, your webcam is in the corner, no test elements visible. Ready to proceed."

3. [During recording] "Quick check - how does my current frame look?"
   AI: "Looking good. Screen content is visible and readable, webcam is active, no overlays blocking important content."

4. "Recording done. How did the final scene look?"
   AI: "Final frame showed your ending slide with contact information clearly visible."

### Layout Design Session

**Interactive scene design with AI feedback:**

1. "I'm redesigning my Gaming scene. Set up frequent captures so you can help"

2. "I moved my webcam to the upper left. How does it look?"
   AI: "The webcam is now overlapping with your game's health bar. I'd suggest moving it down about 100 pixels or to the upper right corner."

3. "Moved it to upper right. Better?"
   AI: "Much better. The webcam is now clear of the game UI and balances nicely with your chat overlay on the left."

4. "I increased the webcam size. Too big?"
   AI: "The webcam is now taking up about 25% of the screen, which feels a bit large for gaming content. Consider reducing to about 15-18% for better balance."

5. "Okay, made it smaller and added a border. Final thoughts?"
   AI: "Great improvements. The webcam size is now proportional, the border adds nice definition, and the overall layout looks professional and balanced."

### Multi-Scene Comparison

**Reviewing consistency across scenes:**

1. "Set up screenshot sources for my Gaming, Chatting, and BRB scenes"

2. "Show me how each scene looks and tell me if they're consistent"
   AI: "Gaming scene: clean layout with webcam bottom-right, game capture fills background.
   Chatting scene: webcam is larger and centered, which is appropriate.
   BRB scene: consistent branding with other scenes, message is clearly visible.
   Overall: Your scenes share consistent color scheme and overlay style. The webcam position varies appropriately by context."

3. "Good to know. Remove the monitoring sources"

### Emergency Visual Diagnosis

**Quick troubleshooting during live stream:**

"Emergency! Chat says my stream looks broken. Quick screenshot and tell me what's wrong!"

AI: [Rapid capture]
AI: "I see the issue: your game capture is showing 'Capture not available' error message. Your webcam and overlays are fine. Try refreshing the game capture source or restarting game capture in OBS."

[You fix it]

"Is it working now?"

AI: "Yes, game capture is now showing your game correctly. Stream looks normal."

**Next Steps**: Practice these workflows in a test environment before using them live. Start with simpler workflows and build up to complex multi-step sequences. Refer back to individual prompt files ([scenes.md](scenes.md), [recording.md](recording.md), [audio.md](audio.md), [screenshots.md](screenshots.md)) for more variations of specific actions.
